# Code-for-diffusion-approximation
A code written in matlab for analysing how light propagates through a domain when it contains an annulus shaped non scattering region ( a region where light does not not scatter ). I have written this code using the code for handling the case where we don't have a non scattering region, written by my supervisor as reference. figurefourpoint5.m and figurefourpoint6.m is written by me. diffusion_approximation.m is written by my supervisor to inspire me.
